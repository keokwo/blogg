## Installation via CLI

Before you run the command, make sure you have **tailwind installed**. If you don't, just see [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) how to install it.

<Note intent="primary">
  This command's gonna nuke your `tailwind config` and `css` file. So, run it in
  a **fresh project**, not in an **old one**. Otherwise, you'll have to manually
  add the needed files.
</Note>

Kick things off by running this command:

<InstallCommand isInit />

Next up, tell it your source. If you're rocking **Next.js**, pick Next.js. If **Laravel** with **Inertia.js** is your jam, go with Laravel. Not using either? Just hit up the **other** option.

After that, just run `add [component-name]` to drop the component in your project. No need to install everything at once. Need a file-trigger? Just add it up. Even if it requires a button, this command's got you covered. Just install what you need now. Otherwise, hit up the docs and do it manually. Here's how to add a `combo-box`:

<InstallCommand isInDocsComponent={false} isAdd items={["combo-box"]} />

This command will install all the required components like:

```bash
✓ combo-box created
✓ select created
✓ dropdown created
✓ field created
✓ list-box created
✓ popover created
✓ button created
```

If ya wanna drop in group components, check the docs, they bundle all the goodies into one namespace, like collections, overlays, forms, etc. So you can slap 'em in all at once like this:

<InstallCommand isInDocsComponent={false} isAdd items={["overlays"]} />

With that command, you'll get all the components in the overlays namespace like this:

````bash
✓ button created
✓ dialog created
✓ modal created
✓ sheet created
✓ drawer created
✓ popover created
✓ tooltip created
```

Or you might wanna pick the components you wanna toss in. Just add 'em without any arguments. You'll get a list of components to select, using arrow keys and spacebar.

<InstallCommand isInDocsComponent={false} isAdd items={[""]} />

The command above will show you list like this:

```bash
? Select components to add: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection, and <enter> to proceed)
 ◯ dropdown
 ◯ dialog
 ◯ dynamic-overlay
 ◯ field
 ◯ forms
 ◯ collections
 ◯ date-and-time
````

Right now, the CLI can only drop one component at a time. So if you try `add note card`, it'll only add the `note` component. If you wanna upgrade it to handle multiple components, feel free to make a [PR](https://github.com/irsyadadl/justd-cli/).

## React Server Component

By default, the primitive gets dropped in the `components/ui` folder of your project. It packs all the must-have functions for your components, like `cn` for className and `composeTailwindRenderProps`. But heads up, you can't rock it in server components. So, if you wanna flex that `cn` class outside the built-in squad, you gotta whip up a file that only holds that function, like this:

```ts title="utils/classes.ts"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";

export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]) => twMerge(clsx(inputs));
```
